  We can re-use the user sign up partial since they have the same field
  We just need to specify that the action_url should POST to session_url and that the form type is now Log In
  We also need to designate that the partial is in another folder

  Note: This only works as-is because they have the same fields, if the sign up had additional 
  fields, we could still re-use the partial, but we'd need to add additional logic
  to conditionally render them for that form type
